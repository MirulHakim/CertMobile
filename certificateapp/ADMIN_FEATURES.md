- **Status Management**: Track certificates through different statuses (Pending, Under Review, Approved, Rejected)
- **Filtering**: Filter certificates by status for easier management
- **Tabbed Interface**: Organized view with tabs for Pending Review, Under Review, and Completed certificates

#### Access:
- Available to users with `admin` or `caVerifier` roles
- Accessible via navigation menu or dashboard quick actions

### 2. Admin Dashboard

A comprehensive admin dashboard providing system overview and management capabilities.

#### Features:
- **System Statistics**: Real-time overview of certificates, users, and system health
- **Recent Activity**: Track recent system events and user actions
- **Quick Actions**: Direct access to common admin tasks
- **System Alerts**: Monitor system health and security alerts
- **Analytics Overview**: View key performance indicators

#### Dashboard Sections:
1. **Overview Tab**: System statistics and recent activity
2. **CA Verification Tab**: Direct access to certificate verification
3. **User Management Tab**: Manage user accounts and permissions
4. **Analytics Tab**: System performance and usage statistics
5. **Metadata Rules Tab**: Configure validation rules
6. **Security Tab**: Monitor security logs and alerts

### 3. Metadata Rule Enforcement

A comprehensive system for defining and enforcing metadata validation rules on certificates.

#### Features:
- **Rule Creation**: Create custom validation rules for certificate metadata
- **Multiple Rule Types**: Support for required fields, format validation, range validation, and custom rules
- **Field Type Support**: Text, number, date, email, URL, and file field types
- **Active/Inactive Rules**: Enable or disable rules without deletion
- **Error Messages**: Custom error messages for validation failures

#### Rule Types:
1. **Required**: Ensures field is not empty
2. **Format**: Validates against regex patterns
3. **Range**: Validates numeric or date ranges
4. **Custom**: Custom validation logic

#### Field Types:
- **Text**: General text input
- **Number**: Numeric values
- **Date**: Date and time values
- **Email**: Email address format
- **URL**: Web URL format
- **File**: File-related metadata

## User Roles and Permissions

## Technical Implementation

### Models

#### Enhanced Certificate Model
```dart
class Certificate {
  // ... existing fields ...
  final CertificateStatus status;
  final String? issuerName;
  final String? issuerId;
  final DateTime? issueDate;
  final DateTime? expiryDate;
  final String? certificateNumber;
  final String? metadataHash;
  final String? digitalSignature;
  final String? approvedBy;
  final DateTime? approvedAt;
  final String? rejectionReason;
  final Map<String, dynamic>? metadata;
  final bool isVerified;
  final String? verificationNotes;
}
```

#### User Model
```dart
class User {
  final String id;
  final String email;
  final String name;
  final UserRole role;
  final String? organization;
  final String? department;
  final DateTime createdAt;
  final DateTime? lastLogin;
  final bool isActive;
  final List<String> permissions;
}
```

#### Metadata Rule Model
```dart
class MetadataRule {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final String description;
  final String fieldName;
  final FieldType fieldType;
  final RuleType ruleType;
  final bool isRequired;
  final String? pattern;
  final dynamic minValue;
  final dynamic maxValue;
  final String? customValidation;
  final String? errorMessage;
  final bool isActive;
  final DateTime createdAt;
  final String createdBy;
}
```

### Services

#### Admin Service

- Tabbed interface for certificate management
- Detailed certificate review
- Approval/rejection workflow
- Status filtering

#### Admin Dashboard Page (`admin_dashboard_page.dart`)
- Comprehensive system overview
- Quick access to admin functions
- Real-time statistics
- System monitoring

#### Metadata Rules Page (`metadata_rules_page.dart`)

- Rule status management
- Error message customization

## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators

1. **Access Admin Dashboard**:
   - Login with admin credentials
   - Navigate to Admin Dashboard from main menu
   - View system overview and statistics

2. **Review Certificates**:
   - Go to CA Verification tab
   - Review pending certificates
   - Click on certificate for detailed view
   - Approve or reject with notes

3. **Manage Metadata Rules**:
   - Navigate to Metadata Rules
   - Create new rules or edit existing ones
   - Configure validation parameters
   - Activate/deactivate rules as needed

4. **Monitor System**:
   - Check system alerts
   - Review security logs
   - Monitor user activity
   - Track certificate statistics

### For CA Verifiers

1. **Review Certificates**:
   - Access CA Verification interface
   - Review assigned certificates
   - Provide verification notes
   - Approve or reject submissions

2. **View Analytics**:
   - Access limited analytics
   - View certificate statistics
   - Monitor verification workload

## Security Considerations

1. **Role-Based Access**: All admin features are protected by role-based access control
2. **Audit Trail**: All admin actions are logged with timestamps and user information
3. **Validation**: Metadata rules provide additional validation layer
4. **Secure Navigation**: Admin routes are protected and only accessible to authorized users

## Future Enhancements

1. **Advanced Analytics**: More detailed reporting and analytics
2. **Workflow Automation**: Automated certificate processing workflows
3. **Integration**: Integration with external CA systems
4. **Mobile Notifications**: Push notifications for pending approvals
5. **Bulk Operations**: Bulk certificate approval/rejection
6. **Advanced Security**: Two-factor authentication for admin access

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Cannot Access Admin Features**:
   - Verify user role is set to admin or caVerifier
   - Check user account is active
   - Ensure proper login credentials

2. **Rules Not Applying**:
   - Verify rule is active
   - Check field name matches exactly
   - Validate rule configuration

3. **Certificate Status Not Updating**:
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify admin service is running
   - Review error logs
